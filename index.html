         The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its
         nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related
         elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of
         any other elements.
      </p>

      <p>
         This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest
         ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay),
         even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor. This effectively inhibits any
         "sticky" behavior (see the Github issue on W3C CSSWG).
